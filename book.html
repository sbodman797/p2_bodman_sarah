				<h4>COLD TEA. CHAPTER 1.</h4>

				<p> Something about staring at a seemingly ordinary object never fails to invade Haley’s ignorant peace. The weapon of choice today: a spoon. The more dull and worn, the easier to spark what people call her “over-active imagination.” While staring at her warped reflection in the shiny metal, her mind moves like a rushing stream. The rough water casually hitting rock shaped topics before moving swiftly onward towards the next consideration. At one point she thinks, “How can one look to the future so admirably, look back so longingly, but simply glance at the present? I mean isn’t the present once considered the future and will one day be the past?” She contemplates this for a while before moving on. Eventually questioning, “how can a warm cup of natural herb infused water help make worry melt away?” Shaking her head at what she considers to be an Aristotle-level contemplation, she catches a glimpse of her large blonde curl glide through the air and land in her chai tea. “Great,” she thinks. “This is what I get for trying to be fancy this morning. I should have just made my typical black cup then I wouldn’t have needed the spoon.” Haley carefully removes the probably drooled-on curl out of the cup and onto the paper towel with a spoon shaped tea ring on it. Disgusted at herself, she dumps the tea in the sink while gripping her hair in the damp napkin. Looking at the time, she says, “time to shower anyway.” So, that was that. The LED lights on the clock decided her next move. “But,” she mumbles to herself, “that is a deep discussion for another day.”</p>
